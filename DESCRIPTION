Description: This package provides an efficient solution for L0 trend filtering, avoiding the traditional methods of using Lagrange duality or ADMM  algorithms. It employ a splicing approach that minimizes L0-regularized sparse approximation by transforming the L0 trend filtering problem. The package excels in both efficiency and accuracy of trend estimation and changepoint detection in segmented functions.
